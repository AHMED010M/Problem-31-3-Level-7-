# Problem Explanation 🔍🔡🔠

This program takes a string and a character from the user, then counts how many times that character appears in the string — both with case sensitivity and without.

- First, the program asks the user to enter a string.
- Then, it asks for a character to search for.
- It counts:
  - How many times the exact character appears (matching upper/lower case).
  - How many times the character appears, ignoring case (counts both uppercase and lowercase versions).
- Finally, it prints both counts.

**Example:**  
If the user enters:  
```
Please Enter Your String?
Hello World
Please Enter a Character?
l
```
The output will be:  
```
Letter 'l' Count = 3
Letter 'l' Or 'L'  Count = 3
```

If the user enters:
```
Please Enter Your String?
Hello World
Please Enter a Character?
o
```
The output will be:  
```
Letter 'o' Count = 2
Letter 'o' Or 'O'  Count = 2
```

This is useful for checking how many times a specific letter appears in a text, whether you care about letter case or not. 📝✨
